When we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly, we improve the Library together. 

### Checklist
1. Offer users mechanisms to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports
3. Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver
4. When appropriate, publish source code of projects or components online
5. When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly

### Key Questions
- How are you collecting user feedback for bugs and issues?
- If there is an API, what capabilities does it provide? Who uses it? How is it documented?
- If the codebase has not been released under an open source license, explain why.
- What components are made available to the public as open source?
- What datasets are made available to the public?
