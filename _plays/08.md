title: Choose a modern technology stack
---

The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source across the technology stack.

### Checklist
1. Choose software frameworks that make sense for the project
2. Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types
3. Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects
4. Consider open source solutions at every level of development

### Key Questions
- What is the development stack and why did you choose it?
- If you did not choose it, how does it fit in with our model?
- Which databases are you using and why did you choose them?
- How long does it take for a new team member to start developing?
