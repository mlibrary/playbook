title: Assign one leader and hold that person accountable
---

Each D&D product must have an identified D&D product owner. The product owner has the authority and responsibility to assign tasks and work elements; make product and technical decisions; when applicable, be the point of contact for the service lead; and be accountable for the success or failure of the overall product. The D&D product owner is ultimately responsible for how well the service meets needs of its users, which is how a service should be evaluated. The D&D product owner is responsible for ensuring that features are built and managing the feature and bug backlogs.

### Checklist
1. A D&D product owner has been identified
2. All stakeholders agree that the D&D product owner has the authority to assign tasks and make decisions about features and technical implementation details
3. The D&D product owner has a product management background with technical experience to assess alternatives and weigh tradeoffs
4. The D&D product owner has a strong relationship with the service lead

### Key Questions
- Who is the D&D product owner?
- What organizational changes have been made to ensure the D&D product owner has sufficient authority over and support for the project?
- What does it take for the D&D product owner to add or remove a feature from the service?
