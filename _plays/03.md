title: Make it simple and intuitive
---

Using a service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting. It’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.

### Checklist
1. Keep it extremely simple, [or two thirds of the population can’t use your design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/).
2. Use a simple and flexible design style guide. Guides are meant to be supportive before being restrictive.
3. Use the design style guide consistently. Update when needed, nothing is sacred.
4. Give users clear information about where they are.
5. Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service.
6. Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand. Use language consistently, both online and offline.
7. Let content drive the design.

### Key Questions
- What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
- Is the language as plain and universal as possible?
- If a user needs help while using the service, how do they go about getting it?
- When is it necessary to update the style guide?
